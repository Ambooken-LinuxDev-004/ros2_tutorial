                                        ################# ROS 2 LOGGER LEVELS #################


ros2 run rqt_console rqt_console - Nodes use logs to output messages concerning events and status in a variety of ways. Their content is usually informational, for the sake of the user.

Fatal - messages indicate the system is going to terminate to try to protect itself from detriment.

Error - messages indicate significant issues that won’t necessarily damage the system, but are preventing it from functioning properly.

Warn - messages indicate unexpected activity or non-ideal results that might represent a deeper issue, but don’t harm functionality outright.

Info - messages indicate event and status updates that serve as a visual verification that the system is running as expected.

Debug - messages detail the entire step-by-step process of the system execution.

ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args --log-level WARN - To set the default logger level when you first run node using remapping.



                                        ################# ROS 2 LAUNCH #################


ros2 launch - start up your entire system(all nodes and their configurations at once).
e.g. ros2 launch turtlesim multisim.launch.py  - launch multiple(2) turtlesim nodes.

ros2 launch <package_name> <launch_file_name> - to launch file.



                                        ################# ROS 2 BAG #################


ros2 bag - a command line tool for recording data published on topics in your system. It accumulates the data passed on any number of topics and saves it in a database. You can then replay the data to reproduce the results of your tests and experiments.


ros2 bag record <topic_name> - To record the data published to a topic.

ros2 bag record -o subset /turtle1/cmd_vel /turtle1/pose - record multiple topics, as well as change the name of the file ros2 bag saves to. The -o option allows you to choose a unique name for your bag file. The following string, in this case subset, is the file name. wing string, in this case subset, is the file name. To record more than one topic at a time, simply list each topic separated by a space. To stop recording press ctrl + C.

NOTE:- 
There is another option you can add to the command, -a, which records all the topics on your system.

ros2 bag info <bag_file_name> - To see details about your recording.
e.g. ros2 bag info subset

NOTE:- ros2 topic hz /turtle1/pose - To get an idea of how often position data is published.



                                        ################# WORKSPACE #################


ROS2 Workspace - a directory with a particular structure.
The build directory will be where intermediate files are stored. For each package a subfolder will be created in which e.g. CMake is being invoked.

The install directory is where each package will be installed to. By default each package will be installed into a separate subdirectory.

The log directory contains various logging information about each colcon invocation.

mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws - create a directory (ros2_ws) to contain our workspace.

** colcon build --symlink-install - To create symbolic links(symlinks) to the original files in the source or build directories instead of making copies.

** source install/setup.bash - To add them to your path and library paths. colcon will have generated bash/bat files in the install directory to help set up the environment.

** echo "source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
** echo "export _colcon_cd_root=/opt/ros/humble/" >> ~/.bashrc

The above command colcon_cd allows you to quickly change the current working directory of your shell to the directory of a package. As an example colcon_cd some_ros_package would quickly bring you to the directory ~/ros2_ws/src/some_ros_package.

** colcon build - To build your packages.



                                    ################# PACKAGE #################


** ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 <package_name> - for creating a new C++ package in ROS 2.

NOTE:- ** ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --license Apache-2.0 <package_name> - for creating a Python based package.
e.g. ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 --node-name my_node my_package

** colcon build --packages-select <package_name> - Builds that particular package.(if there are too many packages in the workspace, then if we use "colcon build", it takes a long time, instead use this).
e.g. colcon build --packages-select my_package

 **** NOTE: AFTER BUILDING A NEW PACKAGE, MAKE SURE TO SOURCE IT, FOR USING THAT PACKAGE IN A NEW TERMINAL ****
 **** source install/local_setup.bash (TRY TO DO IT IN A NEW TERMINAL)****

 rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y - It’s good practice to run rosdep in the root of your workspace (ros2_ws) to check for missing dependencies before building.

 rosdep update - to initialize rosdep installation
 


                                    ################# URDF #################


URDF - Unified Robotics Description Format(it is saved as .xml file). It describes visual, physics, and connections of a robot with joints and links.

Link - used to describe a segment of a robot(defines visual, collision and inertial properties). Geometry and Origin are used in Visual and Collision properties to describe the Shape and Location of link.

NOTE:- To get accurate models, obtain model from any 3D Modelling Software(e.g Solidworks) and export the .stl files for the geometry.

Types of geometry - Box(<box size="x y z"/>), Sphere(<sphere radius="r"/>), Cylinder(<cylinder radius="r" length="l"/>), Mesh(<mesh filename="file_path" scale="x y z"/>)

NOTE:- For Meshes the file types can be .stl or .dae files

Origin - define rotations(using yaw(z)-pitch(y)-roll(x)) and translations(using x, y, z in meters), relative to link's coordinate frame. Order of rotation for rpy is ZYX(first X, then Y and then Z).

NOTE:- The Rotation operation is applied first and then translation.

For visual and collision, Origin describes how geometry is transformed relative to link's frame and for inertial, Origin describes the location of center of mass relative to link's frame.

<origin rpy="r p y" xyz="x y z"/>

Axis colors:- X(Red), Y(Green), Z(Blue).

Material - used to define colors and transparency of color(using rgba).

<material name="color_name">
<color rgba="r g b a"/>
</material>

e.g red-rgba(1001), green-rgba(0101), blue-rgba(0011) etc..

Collision - describe bounding shape around link for collision detection.(use simplified shape for faster calibration).

Inertial - used to describe inertia[kg-m^2] about link's center of mass and mass[kg] of link.
